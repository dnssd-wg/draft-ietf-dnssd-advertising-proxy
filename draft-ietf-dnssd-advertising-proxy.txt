1.  Introduction

   DNS-Based Service Discovery [RFC6763] [ROADMAP] was designed to
   facilitate Zero Configuration IP Networking [RFC6760] [ZC].
   When used with Multicast DNS [RFC6762] with ".local" domain names
   [RFC6761] this works well on a single link (a single broadcast
   domain).

   However, in some applications, multicast may be a poor choice for
   advertising.  Most obviously, multicast DNS is constrained to a
   single network link, and for example in the case of stub networks
   [STUBNET], service discovery for devices on the stub network
   necessarily requires some kind of proxy.

   Also, even in single-link use cases, multicast isn't always the best
   choice.  On some network media, multicast is inefficient and/or
   unreliable.  Also, mDNS-based DNSSD requires that each host providing
   services receive and process all service discovery requests even for
   services they don't offer.  For power-constrained hosts, keeping a
   radio listening all the time is prohibitively expensive.

   Ideally, in situations where multicast DNS is not the right choice,
   an obvious alternative is to use regular unicast DNS [RFC1035].
   Unfortunately, this isn't always possible: the DNS protocol relies on
   a delegation hierarchy, and on per-network DNS resolvers.

   The operational model for such servers is that any particular network
   infrastructure provides a DNS resolver, and all DNS queries go to
   that resolver.  So using unicast DNS for discovery of services
   through a stub network proxy, for example, would require that the
   stub network proxy be able to somehow register with the
   infrastructure DNS service.  This isn't usually possible.

   This document describes a new type of proxy, an Advertising Proxy,
   which can be used to address some of these issues.  An Advertising
   Proxy advertises the contents of some DNS zone (or zones) [RFC1034]
   to one or more network links using multicast DNS.  This allows the
   DNS protocol, for example using the Service Registration Protocol
   registrar function [SRP], to be used by servers to advertise their
   services, while using the permissionless model of multicast DNS to
   make those services discoverable to devices on links supported by the
   Advertising Proxy.

   In its simplest realization, an advertising proxy monitors the
   contents of a DNS zone.  When a new DNS resource record is added to
   the zone, the advertising proxy rewrites that record, replacing the
   domain name of the zone with ".local," and advertises the result
   using mDNS on one or more network links.

   However, more commonly, the advertising proxy function is combined
   with an SRP registrar.  In this case, the SRP registrar and the
   advertising proxy service cooperate to minimize name collisions.
   Such a service may or may not actually respond to DNS queries.

   When an Advertising Proxy is implemented as part of an SRP registrar
   (a DNS authoritative server that implements Service Registration
   Protocol), an SRP requestor can send registration requests for any
   valid DNS records to the SRP registrar.  In practice, the most common
   use is to register the PTR, SRV and TXT records that describe a DNS-
   SD service [RFC6763], and the A and AAAA records that give the IPv4
   and/or IPv6 addresses of the host on which that service can be
   reached.

   Although, as we've said, an Advertising Proxy can monitor a DNS zone
   and advertise its contents, this is not a compelling use case.  The
   reason for this is that we can assume that all DNSSD implementations
   will discover and use infrastructure provided service discovery using
   the DNS protocol if it is available.  We do not need to support a use
   case where a consumer of DNSSD only implements multicast DNS.

   An authoritative DNS zone that is not managed as part of the
   Advertising Proxy really can only exist as an infrastructure service.
   If it exists as an infrastructure service, the right way to make it
   available is to make it discoverable using the mechanisms described
   in Section 11 of [RFC6763].  Since no use case exists for this model
   of Advertising Proxy, we do not attempt to specify how such an
   Advertising Proxy could be made to work.

   Similarly, an Advertising Proxy that, as part of its functioning,
   answers unicast DNS queries, would ideally be included in the DNS
   service provided by the infrastructure, and in this case the
   Advertising Proxy function would not be necessary.  However, because
   in this case the Advertising Proxy functionality is superfluous,
   discussion of this topic is out of scope for this document.

   Therefore, this document limits itself to describing how to implement
   an Advertising Proxy that manages service registrations using the
   Service Registration Protocol.  We do talk about how the Service
   Registration Protocol database should be advertised, but not how it
   can be integrated into an existing DNS infrastructure.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Advertising Proxy

   An Advertising Proxy advertises the contents of one or more DNS zones
   that are maintained using the Service Registration Protocol.  Such a
   service consists of three parts, four of which are required, one of
   which is optional.  These are:

   *  The mDNS Registrar function
   *  The Advertising Proxy function
   *  The SRP registrar function, which includes:
      -  The SRP protocol implementation
      -  The zone database that is updated using the SRP protocol
   *  The DNS authoritative server function, which may include any or
      all of:
      -  Authoritative DNS service for all zones managed by SRP
      -  Discovery Proxy service for all links managed by the
         Advertising Proxy
      -  Full-service DNS resolver or DNS Proxy

   These functions are somewhat interdependent, so while we will discuss
   each separately, there is no way to completely separate them.  After
   discussing each function, we will describe the operation of the
   system as a whole.

2.1.  The mDNS Registrar function

   The mDNS registrar function is an mDNS responder, as described in
   [RFC6762].  We use the term "mDNS registrar" rather than simply "mDNS
   responder" to emphasize the specific function of advertising mDNS
   records, as opposed to browsing or resolving services.

   If Discovery Proxy authoritative resolution service is being offered
   by the Advertising Proxy, the mDNS registrar MUST support querying
   for services and records on the link that are not advertised by the
   Advertising Proxy.

   The mDNS Registrar MUST implement the Time Since Received [TSR]
   record.  This makes it possible to set up redundant Advertising
   Proxies that use SRP replication [REPLICATION] to maintain a common
   set of SRP zones and advertise them without SRP Updates creating
   conflicts.  Such conflicts can occur when, for example, the IP
   address of a host changes and it sends an SRP update.  The new IP
   address conflicts with the old address, which is being advertised.
   Without TSR, the old address will win the conflict, resulting in
   stale data being advertised.  With TSR, the newer data supersedes the
   old data.

2.2.  The Advertising Proxy function

   The Advertising Proxy function mediates between an mDNS registrar and
   the SRP zone database.  Whenever a record is tentatively added to the
   SRP zone database, the Advertising Proxy registers it with the mDNS
   registrar.  If this registration succeeds, the registration is
   finalized; otherwise it is rejected.  The usual reason for rejection
   would be that the name is already taken.  When records expire in the
   SRP zone database, the Advertising Proxy function removes those
   records from its mDNS advertisement.

   Each SRP Update includes a KEY record that is applicable to every
   name claimed in the Update.  SRP Update also includes an EDNS0 Update
   Lease option which may include a KEY-LEASE value that's longer than
   the LEASE value.  In this case, the Advertising Proxy SHOULD
   advertise the KEY record for the duration of the KEY-LEASE, even if
   the other records are removed when the LEASE value has expired.  The
   Advertising Proxy MAY advertise the KEY record even if the LEASE and
   KEY-LEASE values are the same, or the KEY-LEASE valid isn't
   specified.

   Records advertised by the Advertising Proxy all appear in the .local
   domain.  Consequently, these records MUST be rewritten in somewhat
   the opposite of the way a Discovery Proxy Section 5.5 of [RFC8766]
   rewrites them.

   Each zone managed by the SRP registrar function must have a name.  In
   some cases, SRP requestor will discover the name using the Domain
   Enumeration process described in Section 11 of [RFC6763].  However in
   most cases, since advertising proxies aren't integrated into
   infrastructures, the registration domain used by the SRP requestor
   will be the 'default.service.arpa.' domain.  The SRP registrar may
   rewrite incoming registrations into a different zone, or retain the
   'default.service.arpa.' zone name.

   In either case, before advertising a tentative record, the
   Advertising Proxy function first rewrites the record.  First, the
   owner name is transformed by replacing the zone name with '.local'.
   Secondly, for any RR that contains a domain name, that domain is
   transformed in the same way.

   In some cases, the SRP requestor may register one or more address
   records for addresses that aren't valid or reachable on some link on
   which the advertising proxy could advertise them.  The Advertising
   Proxy function MAY filter out such records entirely, or MAY
   explicitly advertise such records only on the link(s) on which they
   are reachable.  This is optional because it requires the Advertising
   Proxy function to have enough information to make such a
   determination, which may not always be the case.

   Where such determinations are possible, the advertising proxy SHOULD
   NOT advertise an IPv4 or IPv6 link-local address, or any other media-
   specific link-scoped address, on any link other than the link on
   which the SRP registration was received.

2.3.  The SRP Registrar function

   The SRP registrar function comprises two components: the SRP protocol
   and the zone database (or databases).  The details of the SRP
   protocol are described in [SRP].

   In the context of an Advertising Proxy, the SRP protocol will be
   updating one or more DNS zones.  It's possible, for example, for an
   SRP registrar to provide SRP service on more than one link, and for
   each link to be treated as a separate DNS zone.  SRP requestors may
   not know what zone they are updating: they may be using
   'default.service.arpa' as a placeholder rather than discovering the
   name of the zone to update.  In this case, updates for
   'default.service.arpa' will be rewritten into the name of the zone
   specific to a particular link.  Note that this separation is not
   required, but is possible and may be desirable.

   In an Advertising Proxy, when an SRP update is received, it is first
   validated according to the SRP specification.  It is then checked for
   uniqueness in the context of SRP, using the SRP first-come, first-
   served mechanism.  Unlike a DNS-only SRP registrar, an Advertising
   Proxy registrar must complete two additional uniqueness checks for
   any name being registered.

   First, the name must be unique across all DNS zones that are being
   advertised together on the same link by the Advertising Proxy.  That
   is, if the zone being updated is advertised on any link, then the
   name being registered must be unique in every zone that is being
   advertised on that link.  If the zone is being advertised on multiple
   links, then for each link, the name must be unique across all the
   zones advertised on that link.

   Secondly, the name must not already be being advertised via mDNS.
   This is easy to check: the Advertising Proxy tentatively advertises
   the name on all links that the corresponding zone is being advertised
   on.  If every tentative advertisement succeeds without detecting a
   conflict, then the advertisement has been successful.  At this point
   the SRP registrar can confirm with the requestor that its
   registration has succeeded.

   If, on the other hand, a conflict is detected in any part of this
   process, then the SRP registrar informs the requestor that the name
   is already taken, by returning the YXDOMAIN response code.

2.4.  The DNS Authoritative Server function

   An Advertising Proxy SHOULD answer DNS queries for the zones it
   manages.  This is not required because in some cases it may not be
   possible.  The zones it manages may not have names in the DNS
   hierarchy, for example, so even if they have locally-assigned names,
   answering authoritatively for these names may be problematic.

   The primary purpose of the Advertising Proxy is to support DNS
   Service Discovery.  In some use cases where Advertising Proxy is
   desirable, the mDNS function can only work on some links, while
   unicast DNS is the only option on others.  This is the case, for
   example, for an Advertising Proxy operating on a stub network router.

   In such a situation, devices on the infrastructure link will do
   service discovery using mDNS.  However, devices on the stub network
   link may not be able to use mDNS, or it may be preferable that they
   do not.  In this case, the Advertising Proxy will need to be able to
   provide the same information that is provided on the infrastructure
   link through a DNS resolver, using the DNS protocol, or, ideally, DNS
   Push [RFC8765].

   Any Advertising Proxy implementing this functionality MAY use the
   'default.service.arpa.' zone as a catch-all zone.  A query to the
   'default.service.arpa.' zone SHOULD return the same set of answers
   that would be returned by an mDNS query to the .local zone on a link
   served by the Advertising Proxy's mDNS registrar.

   When using the 'default.service.arpa.' zone for queries, all
   responses that reference link-specific domains MUST be rewritten to
   use 'default.service.arpa.' domain instead.  This includes domain
   names in the resource record data.  Because the Advertising Proxy is
   required to enforce name uniqueness across all the zones it manages,
   this should not result in any conflicts.

2.4.1.  Discovery Proxy

   In order to fully support the ability to query the Advertising Proxy
   either with mDNS or DNS, it is necessary to provide a Discovery Proxy
   [RFC8766].  The Discovery Proxy provides answers for link-specific
   domains that represent each of the links supported by the Advertising
   Proxy.  These responses are combined with responses from zones
   managed by SRP to produce a complete set of answers to any query
   received by the Advertising Proxy over DNS or DNS Push.

2.4.2.  Full Service Resolver

   In the case of a stub network, the Advertising Proxy may appear to
   devices on the stub network as an infrastructure service.  This would
   mean that the DNS Listener on port 53 (TCP and UDP) and port 853
   (TLS) could be expected to receive queries for arbitrary domain
   names, not just domain names for which the Advertising Proxy is
   authoritative.

   Resolution of such names may not be required for devices on the stub
   network.  For instance, if the stub network has only locally-provided
   IPv6 service using a ULA, devices on the stub network will not be
   able to contact arbitrary devices on the Internet anyway.

   However, in cases where support for connecting to hosts outside of
   the scope of the Advertising Proxy is needed, the Advertising Proxy
   will have to provide a full service resolver (or a DNS Proxy
   [RFC5625]) in addition to its DNS authoritative service and Discovery
   Proxy service.  The details of how this is configured are likely to
   be implementation-specific, and therefore outside the scope of this
   document.

2.5.  Operation

2.5.1.  Late Conflicts

   It is possible for two mDNS responders to advertise conflicting
   records on the same name, but, as a consequence of a network
   partition or multicast packet loss, for neither server to immediately
   detect a conflict.  When this happens, then at some later time one or
   the other mDNS responder will notice the conflict, and begin the
   conflict resolution process.  The outcome of this process may be that
   the record advertised by the Advertising Proxy loses.  In this case,
   the Advertising Proxy MUST stop advertising this record and remove it
   from its database.  There is no way to notify the client when this
   happens, but when the client tries to renew its registration, the
   conflict can be reported.

2.5.2.  No Text-Encoding Translation

   As with a Discovery Proxy [RFC8766], an Advertising Proxy does no
   translation between text encodings [RFC6055].  Specifically, an
   Advertising Proxy does no translation between Punycode encoding
   [RFC3492] and UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629], either in the owner name of
   DNS records or anywhere in the RDATA of DNS records (such as the
   RDATA of PTR records, SRV records, NS records, or other record types
   like TXT, where it is ambiguous whether the RDATA may contain DNS
   names).  All bytes are treated as-is with no attempt at text-encoding
   translation.  A server implementing DNS-based Service Discovery
   [RFC6763] will use UTF-8 encoding for its unicast DNS-based record
   registrations, which the Advertising Proxy passes through without any
   text-encoding translation to the Multicast DNS subsystem.  Queries
   from peers on the configured multicast-capable interface are answered
   directly from the advertised data without any text-encoding
   translation.

2.5.3.  No Support for Reconfirm

   For network efficiency, Multicast DNS [RFC6762] uses fairly long
   record lifetimes (typically 75 minutes).  When a client is unable to
   reach a service that it discovered, Multicast DNS provides a
   "reconfirm" mechanism that enables the client to signal to the
   Multicast DNS subsystem that its cached data may be suspect, which
   causes the Multicast DNS subsystem to reissue queries, and remove the
   stale records if the queries are not answered.

   Similarly, when using unicast service discovery with a Discovery
   Proxy [RFC8766], the DNS Push Notifications [RFC8765] protocol
   provides the RECONFIRM mechanism to signal that the Discovery Proxy
   should perform a local Multicast DNS reconfirm operation to re-verify
   the validity of the records.

   When an Advertising Proxy is used, to support legacy clients that
   only implement Multicast DNS, reconfirm operations have no effect.
   If a device uses unicast Service Registration Protocol [SRP] to
   register its services with a service registry with Advertising Proxy
   capability, and the device then gets disconnected from the network,
   the Advertising Proxy will continue to advertise those records until
   the registrations expire.  If a client discovers the service instance
   using Multicast DNS and is unable to reach it, and uses a Multicast
   DNS reconfirm operation to re-verify the validity of the records,
   then the Advertising Proxy will continue to answer on behalf of the
   departed device until the record registrations expire.  The
   Advertising Proxy has no reliable way to determine whether the
   additional Multicast DNS queries are due to a reconfirm operation, or
   due to other routine causes, like a client being rebooted, or
   disconnecting and then reconnecting to the network.  The service
   registry has no reliable automatic way to determine whether a device
   that registered records has failed or disconnected from the network.
   Particularly with sleepy battery powered devices, the service
   registry does not know what active duty cycle any given service is
   expected to provide.

   Consequently, reconfirm operations are not supported with an
   Advertising Proxy using multicast DNS.  In cases where use of the
   reconfirm mechanism is important, clients should be upgraded to use
   the unicast DNS Push Notifications [RFC8765] protocol's RECONFIRM
   message.  This RECONFIRM message provides an unambiguous signal to
   the service registry that it may be retaining stale records.  (A
   future update to the Service Registration Protocol document [SRP]
   will consider ways that this unambiguous signal can be used to
   trigger expedited removal of stale data.)

3.  Security Considerations

   An Advertising Proxy may made data visible to eavesdroppers on the
   configured multicast-capable link(s).

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
