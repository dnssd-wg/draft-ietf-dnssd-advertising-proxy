I think if we want to allow\r\nthis, the right approach is to only allow it for queries on the same name,\r\nand to make it optional.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in order to not cause harm, we need resolvers that\r\ndon\u2019t support it to respond with just one answer, rather than an error. But\r\nwe can\u2019t be sure that all resolvers that might exist in this context would\r\ndo that. So there is the risk that a resolver might respond with some\r\nerror, forcing the client to send two more messages, or not respond at all,\r\nforcing the client to retry multiple times and then probe.\r\n\r\nWe could argue that using a resolver that doesn\u2019t support whatever behavior\r\nwe specify is an operational error. If we don\u2019t require that, I think we\r\nhave to forbid QDCOUNT>1.\r\n\r\nOp zo 5 nov 2023 om 18:47 schreef Esko Dijk ***@***.***>\r\n\r\n> There was a proposal and long discussion on QDCOUNT > 1 in the thread\r\n> started here:\r\n> https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dnssd/OpEsujhoSFgC_dXBU6kTd3gtqR0/\r\n>\r\n> Can we conclude on this discussion, if/how we could include it, or not, in\r\n> the Advertising Proxy's DNS authoritative server which is used to serve\r\n> query results, based on SRP-registered services, to clients.
